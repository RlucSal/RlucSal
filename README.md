- ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
  
Iâ€™m Rosa, after spending years crafting culinary wonders in the fast-paced chaos of professional kitchens, I find myself at a crossroads, ready to dive into a whole new world: software development. It's a big shift, but one I've been itching to make for a while now.
My journey as a head chef has given me a toolkit of skills that reach far beyond the kitchen. From obsessing over details to juggling a dozen tasks at once, and from thinking on my feet to leading a team through the dinner rush, I've learned lessons that I know will serve me well in my new career.

The allure of web development has always beckoned to me. The idea of building something from scratch, of crafting digital experiences that people interact with every day, it's endlessly fascinating. So, I took the plunge and enrolled in an intensive bootcamp with EdEx and Birmingham University to learn front-end web development.
Let me tell you, those weeks were a whirlwind. From wrapping my head around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to diving into the intricacies of responsive design and frameworks, every day was a challenge. But with each challenge came a sense of accomplishment, a feeling of growth that I hadn't felt in a long time.

Now, as I set my sights on landing an internship in front-end web development, I'm excited for what lies ahead. An internship feels like the perfect next step â€“ a chance to put my newfound skills to the test in real-world projects, to learn from seasoned professionals, and to build connections that will last a lifetime.

What excites me most about this new journey is the sense of collaboration that comes with software development. Just like in the kitchen, where every member of the team plays a crucial role in delivering a memorable dining experience, I know that working alongside other developers will push me to be better, to think differently, and to create truly remarkable things.

So, here I am, ready to embrace the unknown, to tackle challenges head-on, and to grow in ways I never thought possible. This transition isn't just about changing careers â€“ it's about embracing a new way of thinking, a new way of creating, and a new way of being. And I couldn't be more excited to see where it takes me.

- ðŸ‘€ Interests:

As someone who leans towards a vegan-ish lifestyle, I strongly believe that sustainability is the way forward. Our consumption habits need a serious overhaul. We're not just consumers; we're stewards of the planet, and it's time we start acting like it.
For me, it's not just about what's on my plate; it's about the bigger picture. Animals aren't ours to exploit â€“ we're all part of a delicate ecosystem, and every creature has its place. Who are we to decide otherwise?
Beyond ethical considerations, there's a practical side too. Our current food system is simply not sustainable. From the immense resources required to produce animal products to the environmental devastation caused by factory farming, it's clear that change is long overdue.
So, whether it's reducing meat consumption or opting for plant-based alternatives, every small choice we make can have a ripple effect on the planet. And that's a future worth fighting for.

Another pillar in my life is the music. I love techno music, I can't even imagine another thing in the world able to create on me this sort of emotion. Is like a therapy. Sure, I might be a bit past my clubbing days, but nothing beats the rush of hitting a techno festival every few months, it's pure bliss. And let's talk about techno scenes! Spanish, British, German, Dutch, French, and Italian â€“ they're like the masters of the techno universe, don't you agree?

But it's not all about the beats and food; my other obsession is calisthenics â€“ it's my personal commitment to self-improvement. From building strength to improving flexibility and mental focus, calisthenics offers a holistic approach to fitness that keeps me hooked. It's not just exercise; it's a kind of lifestyle, a journey towards becoming the best version of myself.

- âš¡ Fun fact:

Back in my early days as a chef apprentice, I had a memorable mishap: I accidentally overcooked a pricey piece of meat. In a panic, fearing the wrath of the head chef, I swiftly tucked the evidence into my pocket and soldiered on through all the entire service. 
Surprisingly, my culinary crime went undetected, but the adrenaline rush and the absurdity of stashing meat in my pocket made for a tale I'll never forget!
