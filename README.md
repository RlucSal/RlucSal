- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RlucSal After spending years crafting culinary wonders in the fast-paced chaos of professional kitchens, I find myself at a crossroads, ready to dive into a whole new world: software development. It's a big shift, but one I've been itching to make for a while now.
My journey as a head chef has given me a toolkit of skills that reach far beyond the kitchen. From obsessing over details to juggling a dozen tasks at once, and from thinking on my feet to leading a team through the dinner rush, I've learned lessons that I know will serve me well in my new career.
The allure of web development has always beckoned to me. The idea of building something from scratch, of crafting digital experiences that people interact with every day, it's endlessly fascinating. So, I took the plunge and enrolled in an intensive bootcamp with EdEx and Birmingham University to learn front-end web development.
Let me tell you, those weeks were a whirlwind. From wrapping my head around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to diving into the intricacies of responsive design and frameworks, every day was a challenge. But with each challenge came a sense of accomplishment, a feeling of growth that I hadn't felt in a long time.
Now, as I set my sights on landing an internship in front-end web development, I'm excited for what lies ahead. An internship feels like the perfect next step â€“ a chance to put my newfound skills to the test in real-world projects, to learn from seasoned professionals, and to build connections that will last a lifetime.
What excites me most about this new journey is the sense of collaboration that comes with software development. Just like in the kitchen, where every member of the team plays a crucial role in delivering a memorable dining experience, I know that working alongside other developers will push me to be better, to think differently, and to create truly remarkable things.
So, here I am, ready to embrace the unknown, to tackle challenges head-on, and to grow in ways I never thought possible. This transition isn't just about changing careers â€“ it's about embracing a new way of thinking, a new way of creating, and a new way of being. And I couldn't be more excited to see where it takes me.
