- ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
  
Resilient and adaptable Web Developer transitioning from a successful career in hospitality to the tech industry. 
After completing an intensive front-end web development bootcamp at the University of Birmingham, I built expertise in technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, PHP, WordPress, and frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap.
I gained hands-on experience at Haimsa IT, starting as a front-end web development intern and advancing to a contractor role, where I contributed to user-focused, scalable web solutions and developed proficiency in database management with MySQL.
Currently pursuing a CertHE in Applied Computing at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, I am strengthening my software engineering principles and critical problem-solving skills. Passionate about continuous learning and innovation, I am eager to contribute as a Software Developer, delivering impactful solutions in fast-paced environments.

- ðŸ‘€ Interests:

As someone who leans towards a vegan-ish lifestyle, I strongly believe that sustainability is the way forward. Our consumption habits need a serious overhaul. We're not just consumers; we're stewards of the planet, and it's time we start acting like it.
For me, it's not just about what's on my plate; it's about the bigger picture. Animals aren't ours to exploit â€“ we're all part of a delicate ecosystem, and every creature has its place. Who are we to decide otherwise?
Beyond ethical considerations, there's a practical side too. Our current food system is simply not sustainable. From the immense resources required to produce animal products to the environmental devastation caused by factory farming, it's clear that change is long overdue.
So, whether it's reducing meat consumption or opting for plant-based alternatives, every small choice we make can have a ripple effect on the planet. And that's a future worth fighting for.

Another pillar in my life is the music. I love techno music, I can't even imagine another thing in the world able to create on me this sort of emotion. Is like a therapy. Sure, I might be a bit past my clubbing days, but nothing beats the rush of hitting a techno festival every few months, it's pure bliss.

But it's not all about the beats and food; my other obsession is calisthenics â€“ it's my personal commitment to self-improvement. From building strength to improving flexibility and mental focus, calisthenics offers a holistic approach to fitness that keeps me hooked. It's not just exercise; it's a kind of lifestyle, a journey towards becoming the best version of myself.

- âš¡ Fun fact:

Back in my early days as a chef apprentice, I had a memorable mishap: I accidentally overcooked a pricey piece of meat. In a panic, fearing the wrath of the head chef, I swiftly tucked the evidence into my pocket and soldiered on through all the entire service. 
Surprisingly, my culinary crime went undetected, but the adrenaline rush and the absurdity of stashing meat in my pocket made for a tale I'll never forget!
